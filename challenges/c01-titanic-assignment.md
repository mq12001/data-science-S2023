*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category    | Needs Improvement                                                                                                | Satisfactory                                                                                                               |

```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Class
- Sex
- Age
- Survived
- Number

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
  - Very small difference, only off by 1
- Are there any differences?
  - 2201 in this dataset

  - 2202 accounted for on the wikipedia page -

    - 885 crew

    - 1,317 passengers
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - Maybe a stowaway that was eventually in the data for Wikipedia, but
    not accounted for on this manifest?
  - Maybe a person who had booked a ticket but didn’t show?
  - An individual present that there wasn’t class, age, and sex data
    available for

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- More females survived from 1st and 2nd class
- Equal gender survival rates in 3rd class
- Many more men survived from crew
- More Crew survived in general than any class of passenger
- These differences may be because there were many more crew in general
  than specific class of passenger
  - And most crew were men
- Proportion would be more useful here

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- As I thought, more women from each group survived and there were far
  fewer crew that survived compared to their total population in general
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - The proportion is \>1 for some of these groups? More than 100% of
    the men in first class survived, as will as something around 200% of
    the first class women.
    - This is because the groups were sorted by age and THEN added
      together

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ Age)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- 100% of 1st and 2nd class children survived! Cool
- The likelihood of surviving if you are a man goes WAY up if you are
  also a child -
  - Most of the adults that survived, proportion-wise, were female
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - No proportion is over 1 now, thankfully.
    - I do find it a little strange that some proportions are exactly 1?
      Just a skeptic

    - But its no longer nonsensical, data-wise

    - Just a little bit of an alarm raiser, real-world-odds-wise
  - some of the proportions Do add up to over one before being divided
    - Like 1st class women, whom it seems do in fact have a 100%
      survival rate, whether adult or child

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
